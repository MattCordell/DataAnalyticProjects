Supplementary Material for Health Data Analytics 2019 presentation

I've made the the following artefacts available:
* The presentation as presented at [HDA19](https://www.hisa.org.au/healthdataanalytics/program/)
* A Jupyter Notebook, with detailed explanations and code
* The Data Set used for demonstration
 
 Notes:
 The notebook is best viewed at [nbViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MattCordell/DataAnalyticProjects/blob/master/HDA2019/HDA%202019%20Supplement.ipynb?flush_cache=true) because GitHub doesn't render one of the images well (it's fine otherwise.) An interactive option is available via https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MattCordell/DataAnalyticProjects/master, or you can just download the notebook and dataset and run locally (Just uncomment the Pip install lines for any required packages)

 The data set, is a work of fiction, and uses no real patient data. Names, characters, etc are randomly generated by code. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.  The code used to generate it, along with reference material is available at https://github.com/MattCordell/DataGenerator. I've generated it for educational purposes, and it's free to use accordingly.
